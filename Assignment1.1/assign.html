				Everyday Living with the Hamer Tribe

				Around the middle of the road between two of Southern Ethiopia's larger towns - Arba Minch and Jinka, there is a signboard that reads "Welcome to Hamer." The sign marks a dusty road that continues for almost to 100 km, through African bush, towards the region of Turmi, the heart of the Hamer tribe...

				The Iconic Ambassador Taxis of Calcutta (Kolkata).
			</p>
			<p>
				The streets of Calcutta (now, officially Kolkata) always seem to be in a state of traffic gridlock. Most sidewalks are lined with vendors and pedestrians are forced to share the roads with trolleys, buses, rickshaws, and the iconic yellow taxicabs. Getting around town by taxi is certainly the most efficient but it is also the most expensive and thus unaffordable by most of Calcutta’s residents.

				"Arijit Singh, the heartthrob of millions" who's voice has pain and romance which leaves you humming his songs every time you hear his name. A sell out concert in June 2015 at The SSE Arena, Wembley, History was made, to an audience of 10,000.
